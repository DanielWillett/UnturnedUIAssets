# UnturnedUIAssets
Collection of all the icons used by the vanilla UI in Unturned. I do not own rights to these icons, they are property of SDG.

The main point of this is the images in `UI/uGUI/DarkTheme/` which should be used for Unity UI's going for the Unturned style.

There is also a unity bundle at `UI/uGUI/DarkTheme/uGUI Assets.unitypackage` with vanilla UI prefabs.
